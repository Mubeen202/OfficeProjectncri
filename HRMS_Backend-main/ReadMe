# HRMS Project

This is a Human Resource Management System (HRMS) project built with Python and Django.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following requirements met:

1. Python 3.10: Verify that Python 3.10 is installed on your system by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   python --version
   ```

2. Django: Check if Django is installed globally by running the following command:
   ```
   django-admin --version
   ```

3. Pip: Ensure that pip, the Python package installer, is installed. You can check its version by running the following command:
   ```
   pip --version
   ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.

2. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Database Configuration

1. Create a MySQL database for the project.

2. Open the `/HRMS_BACKEND/hrms/settings.py` file and update the database configuration under the `DATABASES` section:
   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
           'NAME': 'YOUR_DATABASE_NAME',
           'USER': 'YOUR-USERNAME',
           'PASSWORD': 'PASSWORD',
           'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
           'PORT': '3306',
           'OPTIONS': {
               'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. Save the file with the updated configuration.

## Database Migration

1. Apply the database migrations by running the following command:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project locally, execute the following command:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

The project will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

Make sure to replace `YOUR_DATABASE_NAME`, `YOUR-USERNAME`, and `PASSWORD` in the configuration with your actual database details.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 and Django should be installed globally on your PC.
- Verify if Python 3 is installed by running the following command:
  ```
  python3 --version
  ```
- Verify if Django is installed globally by running the following command:
  ```
  django-admin --version
  ```
- Verify if pip is installed by running the following command:
  ```
  pip3 --version
  ```

## Setup Instructions
1. Create a virtual environment using the following command:
   ```
   python3 -m venv /path/to/myenv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - For Linux/Mac OS:
     ```
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```
   - For Windows:
     ```
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. Install project dependencies:
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If the above command doesn't work, try using `sudo` at the beginning of the command.

4. Configure the database:
   - Create a MySQL database.
   - Update the configuration in `/HRMS_BACKEND/hrms/settings.py` file as follows:

     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
             'NAME': 'YOUR_DATABASE_NAME',
             'USER': 'YOUR-USERNAME',
             'PASSWORD': 'PASSWORD',
             'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
             'PORT': '3306',
             'OPTIONS': {
                 'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'"
             }
         }
     }
     ```

5. Run database migrations:
   ```
   python3 manage.py makemigrations
   python3 manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Launch the server:
   ```
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```
